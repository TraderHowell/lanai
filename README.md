# Lanai

> [!NOTE]
> This readme and modpack is a work in progress.

Lanai is bundle of quality of life and performance enhancements for vanilla+ gameplay with sane (in my opinion) default configurations built on [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline). Jump right into gameplay instead of spending half your time in a configuration menu!

_This modpack was created so that players of a private server can receive automatic updates to the recommended experience, but anyone who appreciates unobtrusive enhancements out of the box may benefit._
