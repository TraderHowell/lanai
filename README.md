# Lanai
A bundle of quality of life and performance enhancements with sane (in my opinion) default configurations built on [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline). Jump right into gameplay instead of spending half your time in a configuration menu!

_This modpack was created so that players of the private Lanai server can receive automatic updates to the recommended experience, but anyone who appreciates unobtrusive enhancements out of the box may benefit._
